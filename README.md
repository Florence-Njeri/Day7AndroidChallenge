# Day7AndroidChallenge
This is project in which the image disapperars onClicking button if it was visible and it disapperas onClick if it was invisible
1. On app launch, the launch activity page will appear on the screen with an image and button

2. When a user click on the button if the image is showing hide the image but if the image is hidden show the image.
Major Lesson Learnt: You cannot have an OnClick(View view) method and an OnClickListener at the same time since this causes the button
to be clicked twice for it to work correcty on opening activity the first time.
